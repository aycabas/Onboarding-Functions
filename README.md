![Solution architecture](/images/architecture-functions.png)

## Pre-requisites
- [Microsoft 365 Developer Program account](https://aka.ms/m365developers)
- [Microsoft Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Azure Functions Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
- [Azure Storage Emulator](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=717179&clcid=0x409)

## Run the project
1. Create Azure Event Hubs and Key Vault to get Microsoft Graph Change Notifications delivered: [Get change notifications delivered in different ways](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/change-notifications-delivery)

1. Create `local.settings.json` file in your code and add the following code snippet by updating the Event Hub connection string:
    ```json
    {
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
        "OnboardingEventHubs_Listen_EVENTHUB": "EventHub-Connection-String"
    },
    "watchDirectories": [ "Shared" ]
    }
    ```

1. Register an app to Azure Active Directory to handle authentication for the deamon app: [Optional: configure app-only authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorials/javascript?tabs=aad&tutorial-step=7)
    > In the App permissions tab, add `User.Read.All` and `TeamMember.ReadWrite.All` permissions from Microsoft Graph Application Permissions. Grant admin consent for the permissions.

    > Update `Shared/graph.js` file in the code with the required AAD app settings.

1. Run the following commands in your CLI to install the dependencies:
    ```
    npm install @azure/identity @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client isomorphic-fetch readline-sync
    ```

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and run your functions with the following command:
    ```
    func host start
    ```
    >Make sure that Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator is running in the background.

## Test the project

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select Azure Active Directory from the left pane and go to **Users**. Select **+ New user** and **Create new user**. Fill in the details.

1. Once the *OnboardingFunction* triggered successfully, you should be able to see the newly added user as a member of the Onboarding team on Microsoft Teams.

## Code Structure

- **SubscriptionFunction:** Subscribing to  Microsoft Graph `users` change notifications, notifications will be delivered to Azure Event Hubs.
- **OnboardingFunction:** Receiving change notifications from Azure Event Hubs and using the user id to add the user in the Onboarding team.
- **Shared/graph.js:** Shared code that handles Microsoft Graph API calls for `/subscriptions` and `/teams/{team-id}/members`.
